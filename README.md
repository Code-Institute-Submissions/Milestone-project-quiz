# Milestone-project-quiz

**Version 1.0.1**

This is a project for Code Institute Portfolio 2: Project Example Idea 2 "Build an Online Quiz", This quiz will be used to test the users general knowledge through a series of multiple choice questions.

I coloured and styled the website to mimic a monochrome monitor from the 60s - 80s, In doing so I was able to keep the theme of the quiz the same through out the webpage.
